Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a side-by-side comparison of your **current singleton-based `AuthService.custom()` setup** vs. the **recommended Provider-injected approach**.

| **Category**                     | **Your Current Setup (`AuthService.custom()`)**                                            | **Recommended Setup (Provider-injected)**                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instantiation**                | Manual singleton via `AuthService.custom()`                                                | Dependency injected via `Provider` in `main()`           |
| **Usage Example**                | `final authService = AuthService.custom();`                                                | `final authService = Provider.of<AuthService>(context);` |
| **Provider Tree Integration**    | Not integrated; separate from `MultiProvider`                                              | Fully integrated with `MultiProvider`                    |
| **Code Duplication Risk**        | Risk of accidentally creating multiple `AuthProvider` instances if also in `MultiProvider` | Centralized instance via `Provider`, zero duplication    |
| **LateInitializationError Risk** | ‚ùå High ‚Äî if `AuthProvider` is initialized in multiple places                               | ‚úÖ Low ‚Äî single lifecycle-managed instance                |
| **Testability / Mocks**          | ‚ùå Harder to inject mocks for testing                                                       | ‚úÖ Easily mock or override via `Provider` overrides       |
| **Hot Reload Safety**            | ‚ùå Can hold stale state in singleton                                                        | ‚úÖ Auto-disposes and resets on hot reload                 |
| **Scalability**                  | ‚ùå Tighter coupling; harder to manage in large apps                                         | ‚úÖ Loosely coupled; scales well with larger apps          |
| **Dependency Chain Clarity**     | Less clear (hardcoded inside factory)                                                      | Very clear (injected explicitly)                         |
| **Context-free Usage**           | ‚úÖ Can be called without `BuildContext`                                                     | ‚ùå Needs `BuildContext` or needs to be passed down        |
| **Effort to Refactor**           | Already in use, no change needed                                                           | Minor refactor (update `AuthService.custom()` calls)     |

## üîç Bottom Line

| When to Use                                                                 | Recommended Option                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Small, simple app with no `Provider` setup                                  | **Stick with `AuthService.custom()`**             |
| Medium or large app using `Provider`, hot reload, testing, and localization | ‚úÖ **Switch to `Provider`-injected `AuthService`** |

---

In **your case**, since you‚Äôre:

* Already using `Provider`
* Seeing `LateInitializationError`
* Managing multiple user-facing states (theme, locale, auth)

üëâ **I recommend switching to Provider-based injection**.

Would you like a full refactored snippet for `main()` and `LoginView` based on the Provider pattern to make the transition smoother?
