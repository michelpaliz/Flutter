The `EventActionManager` class is primarily focused on handling **UI-related actions** for events, with direct delegation to `EventDataManager` for data-related operations. It provides methods for managing event-related actions, like adding, editing, and removing events. Here's a breakdown of its role compared to the other classes:

### 1. **Primary Purpose**

- **`EventActionManager`**: 
  - Manages the **user actions** related to events, such as adding, editing, or removing events.
  - It acts as an intermediary between the UI and `EventDataManager`, ensuring that user-triggered actions like event updates or deletions are handled by the appropriate backend logic.
  - It focuses on triggering event actions from the UI and handling the flow between UI navigation and backend operations.

### 2. **Key Responsibilities**

- **User Action Handling**:
  - Provides a button for adding events (`buildAddEventButton`) and manages user navigation to the "Add Event" screen.
  - Handles editing events (`editEvent`) by navigating to the "Edit Event" screen and updating the event through `EventDataManager`.
  - Manages event deletion (`removeEvent`) by confirming and then calling `EventDataManager` to remove the event from the backend and the local data source.

- **Delegation to `EventDataManager`**:
  - While `EventActionManager` deals with the **UI-triggered actions**, it doesnâ€™t handle the actual data manipulation. Instead, it **delegates data operations** like updating or removing events to `EventDataManager`.
  - This allows `EventActionManager` to focus on **user interaction logic** while offloading the **data operations** to `EventDataManager`.

### 3. **Comparison with `EventDisplayManager`**

- **`EventDisplayManager`**:
  - Manages the **UI layout and display** of events (building event details, managing swipe actions).
  - Deals with **permissions** (checking if a user has the necessary role to edit or delete events).
  - It handles **how events are visually represented** and how users can interact with them (such as tapping or dismissing).

- **`EventActionManager`**:
  - Focuses on **handling the actions triggered by the user**, such as adding or editing events.
  - It does not build the event's visual representation, but instead, focuses on the **flow of actions** related to events (e.g., navigating to the edit screen or adding a new event).
  - Delegates the actual data modifications (add, edit, delete) to `EventDataManager`.

### 4. **Interaction with `EventDataManager`**

- **`EventActionManager`** heavily relies on `EventDataManager` to perform all data-related tasks:
  - When an event is added or edited, it navigates to the appropriate UI (via `Navigator.pushNamed`) and then calls `eventDataManager.updateEvent` to update the event in the backend.
  - When an event is removed, it calls `eventDataManager.removeGroupEvents` to delete the event from both the backend and local state.

- **Separation of Concerns**: `EventActionManager` is concerned with **user actions** (e.g., navigating to different screens, confirming removals), while `EventDataManager` is concerned with the **data layer** (e.g., interacting with the database or service to persist changes).

### 5. **UI Handling and User Flow**

- **`EventActionManager`** primarily handles **navigation and user input**:
  - It provides a UI button for adding events (`buildAddEventButton`), and handles the **navigation** to the appropriate screens for adding or editing events.
  - It is responsible for managing the **flow of event-related actions** (e.g., confirming a removal, passing the result back from the event editing screen).

- **`EventDisplayManager`**, on the other hand, handles the **visual representation of event details** and user interaction (e.g., displaying event information, handling taps or swipes).

### 6. **Interfacing with the App's UI**

- **`EventActionManager`** interacts with the app's navigation system to handle **adding, editing, and removing events**. 
  - It ensures that the right screens are displayed when a user wants to modify events (e.g., adding or editing an event).
  - It ensures that any changes made on those screens (like adding a new event) are reflected in the app by updating the group or event data via `EventDataManager`.

### Conclusion:
- **`EventActionManager`** is responsible for **handling user-triggered event actions** (add, edit, delete) and navigating between screens, while offloading actual data operations to `EventDataManager`.
- **`EventDisplayManager`** focuses on **how events are displayed** and managing **user interaction** with the event visuals (taps, swipes).
- **`EventDataManager`** handles **backend data operations** and **syncing events** with the server and local state.

In summary, `EventActionManager` facilitates **user interactions and navigation flow** related to events, while **delegating data-related tasks** to `EventDataManager`. This keeps the **UI interaction logic** separate from the **backend operations**, maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities.

|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1             | The user swipes an event to delete it.                                                               | `EventDisplayManager`          | The `buildEventDetails` method in `EventDisplayManager` triggers the swipe action, leading to a removal confirmation dialog.   |
| 2             | A confirmation dialog appears to ask the user if they want to remove the event.                      | `EventDisplayManager`          | The `_showRemoveConfirmationDialog` method opens the dialog and waits for the user's response.                                |
| 3             | The user confirms the removal.                                                                       | `EventDisplayManager`          | Once confirmed, the dialog closes, and the swipe action continues.                                                             |
| 4             | The event removal is handed over to `EventActionManager`.                                            | `EventDisplayManager` -> `EventActionManager` | The confirmed event removal triggers the call to `EventActionManager.removeEvent`.                                             |
| 5             | `EventActionManager` delegates the data removal to `EventDataManager`.                               | `EventActionManager` -> `EventDataManager`  | The `removeEvent` method in `EventActionManager` calls `removeGroupEvents` in `EventDataManager` to handle the data removal.   |
| 6             | The event is removed from the backend (e.g., Firestore) and from the local event list.               | `EventDataManager`             | `EventDataManager.removeGroupEvents` ensures the event is deleted from both Firestore and the local `_events` list.           |
| 7             | The UI updates to reflect that the event has been deleted.                                           | `EventDataManager` -> `EventDisplayManager`  | `EventDisplayManager` updates the UI after the event has been successfully removed from the backend and local storage.         |

Example Flow in Action:

    Step 1: A user swipes on an event in the calendar, initiating the deletion flow.
    Step 2: A confirmation dialog appears, asking if the user is sure they want to remove the event.
    Step 3: The user confirms the deletion.
    Step 4: The deletion request is passed from EventDisplayManager to EventActionManager.
    Step 5: EventActionManager calls EventDataManager to handle the backend data deletion.
    Step 6: EventDataManager removes the event from Firestore and the local list of events.
    Step 7: The UI is updated, and the event no longer appears in the list.
