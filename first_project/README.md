## Basic Usage
In the realm of work, every project and task typically follows a specific schedule or routine. Consequently, organizations require a means for their employees to manage these schedules effectively. This is precisely where the "Calendar" application comes into play. It provides companies with a solution to enhance collaboration by utilizing a shared calendar, enabling teams to work asynchronously while adhering to their schedules.

## Group Usage and Functionality
Groups within the "Calendar" app are structured with an administrator, who serves as the group's owner. The administrator has the authority to add members by searching for their unique usernames. Additionally, the administrator can assign specific roles to each member, which are detailed further in the "Roles" section. Groups offer various functionalities, including event creation (explained in the "Events" section), settings management (detailed in its respective section), and displaying a horizontal list of group members along with their names.

In summary, groups are collections of diverse users representing the organization, aiming to facilitate communication through a shared calendar.

## User Features
Each user possesses their own set of events, which are used to construct their personalized calendar.

## Calendar Features
The calendar showcases the events that users have created, providing an organized view of their schedules.

## Key Features
A user can associate multiple calendars but will receive notifications from a single calendar or multiple calendars simultaneously.

## Events
An event within the "Calendar" app comprises various attributes, including a title, start date, end date, location, description, notes, and event repetition.

## Streamlined Event Management in the "Calendar" App

In the "Calendar" app, events are richly detailed with a range of attributes to enhance your scheduling experience. These attributes encompass:

1. **Title:** Give your event a meaningful name.
2. **Start Date:** Set the event's commencement date.
3. **End Date:** Specify when the event concludes.
4. **Location:** Indicate the event's designated place.
5. **Description:** Provide context or additional information about the event.
6. **Notes:** Include any important reminders or notes.
7. **Event Repetition:** Tailor how often the event recurs.

### Event Repetition Choices

You can customize the event's repetition using the following options:

**1. Daily:** Configure the interval and select the date until which the event repeats.

**2. Weekly:** Determine the interval, choose specific days of the week, and set the end date for weekly repetitions.

**3. Monthly:** Define the interval and the concluding date for monthly recurrence.

**4. Yearly:** Opt for the interval and until date for yearly repetitions.

This refined event management system grants you precise control over your events and timetables within the "Calendar" app, ensuring your commitments are effortlessly organized and tracked.
