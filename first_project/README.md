CALENDAR BY MICHAEL PALIZ MORALES.

## Getting Started
This idea came out from a necessity of many companies that are always in the need of an application that can help them to work in a better manner/way of doing tasks more asynchronously and more efficiently.
The main reason that I decided to create this app is to help companies to have a better management for themselves and for their employees.
### Basic Usage
When we are talking about work we always want to have some sort of calendar for each specific project/task, but we also want our workers/co-workers to have a calendar. This app will help us to share a calendar for the group, this will enable the group to work asynchronously and make sure we are following the schedule that we got in our calendar.

A group is composed by a group of workers which will help them to work with an unique calendar, this is very simple, the group has a calendar where the members will be able to share the calendar. Therefore groups will have roles for each member of the group, each role will represent a function for the calendar and for the group. The roles are the following ones; administrator, co-administrator and member; administrators can add, remove and edit events, meanwhile co-administrators can only add events, and finally the members can only view the events.

### User features 
The user possess events, those events are used to create a unique calendar for the user.
### Group features
Groups are composed of different users which represent the groups itself, the purpose of the group is to create a way to communicate with  the members of the group with a calendar
### Calendar features
The calendar shows the events that the user wants to create
### Key features
A person can have multiple calendars associated but it can be notified by one calendar
