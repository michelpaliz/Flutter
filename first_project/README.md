# first_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
### Basic Usage
When we are talking about work we always want to have some sort of calendar for each specific project/task, but we also want our workers/co-workers to have a calendar. This app will help us to have the same calendar, this will enable us to work asynchronously and make sure we are following the schedule that we got in our calendar.

A group is composed by a group of workers which will help them to work with an unique calendar, this is very simple, the group has a calendar where the memebers will be able to share the calendar. Therefore groups will have roles for each member of the group, each role will represent a function for the calendar and for the group. The roles are the following ones; administrator, co-administrator and member; administrators can add, remove and edit events, meanwhile co-administrators can only add events, and finally the members can only view the events.

<h3>User features</h3>
<p> The user poses events, those events are used to create a unique calendar for the user. </p><br>
<h3>Group features</h3>
<p>Groups are composed of different users which represent the groups itself, the purpose of the group is to create a way to communicate with  the members of the group with a calendar</p>
<h3> Calendar features</h3>
<p> The calendar shows the events that the user wants to create </p>
<h3> Key features</h3>
<p> A person can have multiple calendars associated but it can be notified by one calendar</p>
