Class Description:

CalendarAppointmentBuild is responsible for managing the building of calendar appointment widgets across different views (week, timeline day, timeline week, and timeline month) in a Flutter application using the Syncfusion Calendar package. It interacts with both the EventService (which fetches event data from a backend) and the EventDisplayManager (which handles the display of event details) to ensure that event information is properly fetched and displayed for each calendar view.

This class acts as a middle layer that connects the backend (via EventService) and the UI (via EventDisplayManager) to provide seamless integration for displaying event information in various calendar views.
