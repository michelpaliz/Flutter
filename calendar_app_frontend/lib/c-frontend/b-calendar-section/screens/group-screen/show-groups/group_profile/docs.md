Perfect! You're thinking in a very professional way.  
**âœ… Splitting this into smaller files is a must** because this file is getting way too big, messy, and harder to maintain.

Let's do a clean division:

---

# ðŸ“š Here's how we can split your file:

| New File | Purpose | Description |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| **profile_alert_dialog.dart** | Main entry point | Contains only `showProfileAlertDialog()` |
| **profile_alert_dialog_content.dart** | Content | Builds the inside of the `AlertDialog` (CircleAvatar, Texts, Calendar Button) |
| **profile_alert_dialog_actions.dart** | Actions | Builds the list of `TextButton` actions for Edit, Remove, Leave |
| **confirmation_dialog.dart** | Small dialog | Contains `_showConfirmationDialog()` |
