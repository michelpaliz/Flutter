Great question — and very important to clarify.

### 🔁 TL;DR:

* `**recurrenceRule**` is your **structured model** (`LegacyRecurrenceRule`) used in the app for form editing, dropdowns, logic, etc.
* `**rule**` is the **final RRULE string** (like `FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=3;UNTIL=20250730T220000Z`) generated from `recurrenceRule` and **used by the `rrule` package** to generate event instances on the calendar.

---

### 🔍 In Detail:

#### 🧩 `recurrenceRule` (type: `LegacyRecurrenceRule`)

* A **Flutter-side model**.
* Easy to build, edit, and manage.
* Fields like:

  ```dart
  int repeatInterval;
  RecurrenceType recurrenceType;
  DateTime untilDate;
  List<CustomDayWeek> daysOfWeek;
  ```
* Used in the **event editing UI**, dropdowns like:

  > "Every 2 weeks on Monday & Wednesday until July 30"

#### 🧵 `rule` (type: `String`)

* A **raw iCalendar RRULE string** used by the [`rrule`](https://pub.dev/packages/rrule) Dart package.
* Example:

  ```
  FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=3;UNTIL=20250730T220000Z
  ```
* Used to **generate actual recurring dates** in this method:

  ```dart
  rrule.RecurrenceRule.fromString(event.rule)
  ```

### 🧠 Why You Need Both

| Purpose                                    | Uses `recurrenceRule` | Uses `rule` |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Editing in forms                           | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Backend sync (structured rule ID)          | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Generating repeated events on the calendar | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Using the `rrule` package                  | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |

---

### ✅ Best Practice

When the user edits recurrence:

1. You **update `recurrenceRule`**.
2. You **generate `rule`** using:

   ```dart
   recurrenceRule.toRRuleString(startDate);
   ```
3. You **store both** in the `Event` model.

---

### Bonus Tip 💡

Make sure in `expandRecurringEventForRange()` you always use `event.rule` and not try to build the RRULE string there — because editing might update `recurrenceRule` but not yet regenerate the `.rule` string if not synced.
